        Be more lenient with decoding compressed responses, since (very rarely)
        servers send slightly invalid gzip responses that are still accepted
        by common browsers.

        Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

        Otherwise request from the browser could end up
        on the domain of the current url. For the dashboard
        this would mean the UI nginx would respond with
        the page not found page, and that content would
        have ended up being saved as the token.

        Stops using circleCI for npm deploys.
        No longer runs the tests before publishing, since that resinCI
        step is meant to be really slim and also the image used doesn't
        have Chrome installed (see attached discussion).
        Should not be a concern since:
        * the tests were run before merging to master
        * we are moving away from manual publishing.
        ResinCI requires zero configuration so most of the time
        there is no reason to publish anything manually.

        This was probably missed during the rename PR.
        It seems that we updated the devDependency to v3
        and missed to also update the version for the
        peerDependency.
        Also note that balena-auth starts with v3.
